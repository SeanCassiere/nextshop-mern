# Nextshop

This project was build following Brad Traversy's [MERN stack online course](https://udemy.com/course/mern-ecommerce/).

Since then, the following changes have been applied to the tutorial project.

- migrated to typescript.
- frontend migrated to vite and redesigned with tailwindcss.
- project restructured to have `package.json` for each component in separate folders.
- added Stripe checkout as a payment option
